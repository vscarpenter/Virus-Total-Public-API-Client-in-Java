# Virus-Total-Public-API-Client-in-Java
VirusTotal, a subsidiary of Google, is a free online service that analyzes files and URLs enabling the identification of viruses, worms, trojans and other kinds of malicious content detected by antivirus engines and website scanners. At the same time, it may be used as a means to detect false positives, i.e. innocuous resources detected as malicious by one or more scanners.

VirusTotal's Public API lets you upload and scan files, submit and scan URLs, access finished scan reports and make automatic comments on URLs and samples without the need of using the HTML website interface.
